  <p> <b1> It is the most successful English team in European
    football tournament history,
    having won six European Champions
    League trophies, <b1>   
    is not evenly spread throughout the league and there is a 
    huge gulf between the most and
    least popular teams,
    plus around the world they have 92.7 million fans.
    Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites,
    a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit,
    on the Kop at Anfield </p>
